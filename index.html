<a name="about"><h3><u>About</u></h3></a>
<p>I’m a Graphic Designer who hopes to aid people in bringing their vision to life. I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic Design.

  I have nine years of experience of creating, designing, and working with clients under my belt. Some tools in my repertoire includes Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Indesign.
  
  I offer logo design, character design, and other design/graphic work. My approach for any logo design is to sketch out different rough ideas and create them in Adobe Illustrator, tweaking and refining the design along the way.
  
  If the client already has a logo in mind, I make it my duty to bring the logo to life with the tools at my disposal.
  
  The reason I use Illustrator for logo creation is because the client should have the opportunity to resize the logo to any size of their choosing and not have to worry about image degradation.
  
  I offer affordable prices and with my knowledge and experience with logo design and vectorization, you can expect to see your vision come to life.
  
  My sample work is just the beginning of what I can offer you; some of the work is original while other designs are based on the client’s own idea and description.
  
  Hopefully this will allow us to work together in the future!</p>
